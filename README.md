# WeatherApp

A Beautiful Angular 2 weather application using open weather api supporting the ability to sign up and add list of cities.<br>
based on <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/11/04/rain-water-effect-experiments/">Rain & Water Effect Experiments by Lucas Bebber</a>

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.17.

# install
make sure you have NodeJs and angular-cli installed then cd to ng2-authentication folder and run
```bash
npm install 
```
to run the app 
```bash
ng serve 
```
then with your browser, navigate to localhost:4200 

# Live Demo

https://weweather-fa9e7.firebaseapp.com<br>
in order to make this demo work, you should load unsafe script, because open weather api doesn't<br>
support HTTPS calls in free accounts and firebase will block HTTP API calls.
